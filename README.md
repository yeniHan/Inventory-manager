"Inventory manager" is my first work using API technology 
I created this while learning in W-coidng academy. 

Functionalities:
1)List of all items(List_01) and "reversing the order" functionality.
  The list of all items arranged by quantity by default.
  But, by clicking "Reverse" button, a user can reverse the order of the items.


  provide the lists to show the stock status of the items
  * "Standartd time": (Default) The time when a user came to the page at first.

2)Lists of the 3 most stocked items and the 3 least stocked items(List_02, List_03)
  The lack of particular items can be a very important issue to manage stocks.
  * In the 3 least stocked item list, items are listed with a warning sign.
